# Higher-Lower-Game
Guess Celebrity who has more followers

This repository contains a simple set of code for a simple version of the HigherLower game. The game rule is very simple:

  >The player will be presented with 2 social media influencers.
  
  >The player will then guess which account has more follower.
  
  >If right, the player will be rewarded 1 point and the question will move on in a manner of a conveyer belt:
  
  >The first social media account disappears, the second account in the first comparison becomes the first in the second comparison, a new 'third' account appears and so    on.
  
  >If the player guesses wrong, the game stops, the score is displayed.
